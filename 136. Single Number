Q). Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 Example 1:
  Input: nums = [2,2,1]
  Output: 1

Example 2:
  Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
  Output: 4

Example 3:
  Input: nums = [1]
  Output: 1


Since XOR gives 0 if there are 2 same values like: a^a=0

then,

def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        z=0
        for i in nums:
            z=z^i
        return z
